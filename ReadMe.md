	- Explanations of the technologies used
	

* -For Plan My Plate the following technologies were implemented:
	- Figma was used to prototype the project and draw the RED model as well 
	- Express and node.js was used for the implementation of the backend  
	- MongoDB was used for creating and storing the database 
	- React was used for the frontend implementation 
	- Cloudinary was used to upload and retrieve and images 
	- Insomnia to test the API funcitionality before implementation in the frontend
	- A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
	

* -In short the approach  for the project is : 
Starting with the ERD model to identify the needed model and how they interact together 
Moving on to Figma and creating a full prototype of the website with all the needed pages and the interactions with each page 
Segmenting the project into small sections and completing each one of them fully before moving to the next one.

* -As this project deal with backend and front end we Started  by creating a full functioning backend and checking it with insomnia before moving into react to create the components.
Running both frontend and backend project and testing 
	- Installation instructions for any dependencies
	

* -After downloading the project from GitHub , user will need to download on both backend and frontend node_modules , cloudinary , express , axios ,bootstrap-react 
	- Documentation of your application architecture
	- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or Data Model.
	- Your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
